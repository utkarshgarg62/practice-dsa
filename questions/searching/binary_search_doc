## BINARY SEARCH TIME COMPLEXITY : O ( log n)

=> TIME COMPLEXITY are of 3 Types:
    - best case scenario  => O(1)
    - worst case scenario => O(logn)
    - avg case scenario => O(logn)

* Binary Search work on only sorted array. 
    * or sort the array then use binary search.
        [For unsorted array best option is linear search]

* For very very large arr or document, binary search would be bad choice.
