// QUEUE --------------
// A queue is a linear list of elements in which deletions can
// take place only at one end called front and insertions can
// take place only at the other end called rare.

// Queue is based on the FIFO - First in First Out

// RealLife example - Peoples are standing in the queue to go
// inside a bus, person standing in front of queue will firstly
// inside a bus, and person at last of queue will get at last.
