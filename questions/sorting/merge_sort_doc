## MERGE SORT TIME COMPLEXITY : O (nlogn)

=> TIME COMPLEXITY are of 3 Types:
    - best case scenario  => O(nlogn)
    - worst case scenario => O(nlogn)
    - avg case scenario => O(nlogn)

* Merge sort is very complex but has less time complexity.
* It is a best option for larger size array as compared to bubble sort.

=> Steps in merge sort :
    - Recursion
    - Merge
